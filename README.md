## Description

**x4x** is a strict XMRIG's fork incorporating randomX algorithm variant for mining XDAG. It's based on the [Swordlet project](https://github.com/swordlet/xmrig/tree/xdag) using [XMRig 6.18.0](https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig/releases/tag/v6.18.0). It's specially designed to improve XDAG mining :

* **algorithms other than RandomX have been removed** at compilation (_CryptoNight, Argon2, KawPow and GhostRider_),
* **_CUDA_ and _OpenCL_ support have been removed** at compilation too (_GPUs are useless to mine XDAG_).
* **the fees have been set to zero** for improving mining and to avoid disconnections to XDAG mining pools,
